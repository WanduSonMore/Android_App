# Android_App

# Overview

I created this Android app with the purpose of learning how to create an app for Android through the use of a tutorial and to possibly use it for the future. The app is a very simple message input app with a place to type in your message and button to submit the message and pops up a window that displays the submitted message. All you need to do to using it is to type your message out and submit it by pressing the button.



{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* I should probably change the name on the button from button to submit to make it easier to understand.
* There isn't a lot of improvement that need to be made because it is functioning as it was designed to..
* I could add to the code to make it into something more useful to me.
